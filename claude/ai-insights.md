- Repository pattern implementation
- Test fixtures
- Saved ~2 hours

**2. Standard Patterns (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)**
- Dependency injection
- Service layers
- Correct when told which pattern

**3. Test Generation (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)**
- Happy path + edge cases
- AAA pattern
- Comprehensive coverage

## Human Critical

### 1. Concurrency Bugs

**AI missed:**
```python
# Race condition - check-then-act not atomic
if balance < amount:  # Check
    raise Exception()
balance -= amount     # Update - NOT ATOMIC
```

**Why:** AI doesn't inherently understand thread interleaving

**Fix required:** Explicit prompt about atomicity

### 2. Domain Knowledge

**AI used:** `float` for money (wrong)

**Human needed:** "Use Decimal for financial precision"

**Lesson:** Domain expertise must be stated explicitly

### 3. Test Validation

**AI:** Writes tests

**Human:** Validates by breaking code

```
Write test → passes → break code → fails ✅ → restore
```

**Without this:** No proof tests catch bugs

### 4. Tradeoffs

**AI:** Lists options

**Human:** Contextualizes for scale, team, timeline

---

## Effective Prompting

### ❌ Vague
```
Make it thread-safe
```

### ✅ Specific
```
Balance check and update must be atomic.
Acquire locks on both accounts in sorted order.
Explain why ordering prevents deadlocks.
```

**Pattern:** Specificity + "Explain why"

### ❌ Assume Knowledge
```
Add proper validation
```

### ✅ Explicit
```
Validate amounts have max 2 decimal places (financial precision)
```

**Pattern:** State domain constraints

---

## Iteration Process

```
Prompt → AI Draft → Identify Issues → Refined Prompt → Better Output
                           ↓
                    Human Enhancement
```

**Example:**
1. "Implement transfer" → Race condition
2. "Fix race with locks" → Deadlock risk
3. "Add lock ordering" → Correct
4. Human adds comments

**Expect:** 2-3 iterations for complex concurrency

## Time Breakdown

| Phase | Time | AI% | Human% |
|-------|------|-----|--------|
| Setup | 30m | 70% | 30% |
| Concurrency | 75m | 40% | 60% |
| Testing | 45m | 60% | 40% |
| API | 30m | 80% | 20% |
| Docs | 40m | 50% | 50% |

**Key:** AI for boilerplate, human for critical thinking

---

## Critical Human Contributions

1. **Identified check-then-act race condition**
   - Impact: Prevents negative balances

2. **Lock ordering for deadlock prevention**
   - AI's first attempt: Lock in transfer direction (wrong)
   - Human: Lock in sorted order

3. **Test validation methodology**
   - Break code to prove tests work

4. **Decimal precision validation**
   - Max 2 decimal places for financial data

---

## Key Learnings

**Domain expertise matters:**
- AI doesn't know finance needs Decimal
- AI doesn't inherently understand race conditions
- Human must inject domain knowledge

**Verification essential:**
- AI claims "thread-safe"
- Only tests prove it
- Break-it-to-prove-it validates

**Tradeoff analysis needs context:**
- AI lists options
- Human decides for 100K vs 10M users

**Iteration is normal:**
- Complex logic takes 2-3 rounds
- Not a failure, expected process

---

## What AI Is / Isn't

**AI IS:**
- ✅ Code generation accelerator
- ✅ Pattern implementation tool
- ✅ Boilerplate eliminator

**AI ISN'T:**
- ❌ Concurrency expert
- ❌ Domain knowledge source
- ❌ Output validator
- ❌ Architecture decision-maker

---

## Recommendations

**Do:**
1. Start with AI for scaffolding
2. Review critically for domain issues
3. Validate with tests
4. Enhance documentation depth

**Don't:**
1. Blindly trust output (especially concurrency)
2. Skip test validation
3. Let AI make architecture decisions
4. Assume domain knowledge

---

## Code Review Signals

**Strong:**
- ✅ Caught race conditions
- ✅ Tests fail on broken code
- ✅ Explains why decisions matter
- ✅ Documents tradeoffs

**Weak:**
- ❌ "AI wrote it, I ran it"
- ❌ Tests don't catch bugs
- ❌ No tradeoff analysis
