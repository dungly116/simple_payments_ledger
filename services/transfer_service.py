class TransferService:

    Service for atomic fund transfers between accounts.

    Key Design Decision: Account-Level Locking
    - Each account has its own lock
    - Transfers acquire locks on both accounts in sorted order (by account ID)
    - This prevents deadlocks while allowing parallel transfers on different account pairs

    Alternative Considered: Global lock for all transfers
    - Pro: Simpler, no deadlock risk
    - Con: Serializes ALL transactions (poor throughput for 100K users)
